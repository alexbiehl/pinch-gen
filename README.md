`pinch` aims to provide an alternative implementation of Apache Thrift for
Haskell. The `pinch` library itself acts only as a serialization library. Types
specify their Thrift encoding by defining instances of the `Pinchable`
typeclass, which may be done by hand or automatically with the use of Generics.

Haddock documentation for this package is avilable on [Hackage] and [here].

Overview

Converts a Thrift file into Haskell code for the pinch library.


Caveats

The generated code is currently not formatted very nicely.
